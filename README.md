# 📖 Overview

TruthGuard AI is an end-to-end NLP application designed to detect fake news using a hybrid approach.

Instead of relying only on machine learning predictions, the system combines:

- Fine-tuned DistilBERT
- Google Fact Check API
- NewsAPI
- Confidence-based decision logic

to provide evidence-backed predictions with real-time verification.

# ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanshikasoni11/TruthGuard-AI

cd TruthGuard-AI
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 📊 Dataset

Dataset Used:

Fake and Real News Dataset (Kaggle)

Total Articles:

- 44,898+ news articles
- Binary Classification
- REAL
- FAKE

The dataset was cleaned, preprocessed, tokenized, and used for fine-tuning DistilBERT.

---

# 🤖 Model Training

Train DistilBERT

```bash
python src/train_bert.py
```

The training script:

- Loads the dataset
- Tokenizes text using DistilBERT tokenizer
- Fine-tunes DistilBERT
- Evaluates the model
- Saves trained weights

Saved Model

```
outputs/bert_model/
```
